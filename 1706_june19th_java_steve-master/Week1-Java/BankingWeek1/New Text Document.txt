This is an example project of the Banking Assignment
	used with XML instead of a Database

Everything remains the same except for the code
	that will persist our POJOs will to
	an XML file instead of using JDBC

You will see that the DaoImpl doesn't do any
	business logic, only CRUD operations
	(it also it using generics but that
	 was not a requirement)
